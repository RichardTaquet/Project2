Presentation

This is supposed to be an app using a Pokemon API rest.

Problems encountered

Despite following the videos, errors that I just couldn't find kept popping up.
Problems with committing, pushing and making side branches with git.
Ever since I did the PokeRepository the app constantly and instantly crashes, but dont know why and cant find a way to go back to before.

Functions

App uses MVC architecture and respects SOLID principles.
It used to have a second screen and saved data on the cache. This isn't the case anymore since the app just doesnt launch anymore.
Uses singletons for recurring objects.
